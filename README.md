This is the repository for the WordPress plugin: [Live Members Counter for Discord](https://wordpress.org/plugins/live-members-counter-for-discord/)

Live Members Counter For Discord is an one of a kind plugin which helps you embed the members count from all your Discord servers, and comes with an interactive dashboard to edit the appearance of your members counter.

## Installation

You can install the plugin for your wordpress site from the [WordPress Plugins Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/live-members-counter-for-discord/). Installation requires you to set up a Discord Bot through which the plugin can query your server's members count. Detailed instructions are mentioned in the [Plugins Directory page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/live-members-counter-for-discord/#installation).

## Contributing

The plugin does not require any external dependencies. Currently, the plugin only shows the (pseudo)live members count of all the Discord servers using WPCron and the Discord REST API. But more features will be worked on for a full fledged Discord integration.
